# C-Hotel-Project
A program I have made during my studies of C.
This program uses unsafe functions that do not support buffer overflow (scanf for example) 
When using the program, please do not use spaces. 
For example, when running the exe, and pressing 2 to add a customer, you will be asked for a name.
Simply write your first name.
To safely when the program is stuck, press Ctrl+C.

Thank you.


The program Replicates the basic functions of a hotel.
You can add customers, with their credit card (It only checks for length, it doesn't use the standard algorithm for checking credit card viability).
You can check in, check out.
Press 1 to see the status of the hotel.

Have fun!
